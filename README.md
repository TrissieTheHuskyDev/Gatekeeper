# Acknowledgements
 Thanks to Tara for giving me access to the code and setting this rewrite
 into action.
 Special thanks for all of the awesome members of the Valley discord
 community, for whomst this project was originally created.
 
# Future Improvements
 Add system to automatically log messages
 Add punishment system for softmute, where they can only see announcements,
  rules, and other basics, but can still talk in the help channels.
 Set up bot so it will use guild.member.display_name as opposed to the
  user.name it currently operates on.
 implement website whitelist.
